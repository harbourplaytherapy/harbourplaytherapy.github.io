            Here you can find out more about what play therapy is and how it could help a child you know.
            I am a child-centred play therapist based in Oxfordshire.

            <p>
            My name is Louise and I am a certified play therapist (PGDip), accredited by Play Therapy UK (PTUK).
            I am based in Oxfordshire but also work in the surrounding counties.
            </p>
            <p>
            I am a qualified primary school teacher and worked for 15 years in a number of schools around the UK.
            My passion has always lain in supporting a child's emotional and mental needs and working as a certified
            play therapist is how I am now able to do this.
            </p>
            <p>
            Being a member of PTUK means that I have thorough training in areas such as child development, trauma, neuroscience and attachment.
            I also abide by their ethical principles and receive regular clinical supervision.
            </br>
            See <a target="_blank" href="https://playtherapy.org.uk/ethical-framework/">https://playtherapy.org.uk/ethical-framework/</a> for more information.
            </p>
            <p>
            I work on a one-to-one basis with children to support them in making sense of any difficult or confusing emotions.
            I also work with small groups of children who have a common therapeutic need.
            </p>
            <p>
            I have experience working in parental separation, bereavement, abuse, attachment, global learning delay, autism and anxiety, amongst other areas. 
            </p>
            <p>
            An integral part of my work involves working closely with schools and families to enable us to provide the best support to the child we can.

                        <p>“Play is the language of children, toys their words” - Garry Landreth.</p>
                        <p>Play therapy helps children understand muddled feelings and upsetting
                            events that they haven't had the chance to sort out yet.  It can also
                            help children to gain in confidence and improve their social skills.
                            Rather than having to explain their feelings, a child can use play to
                            communicate at their own level.
                        </p>
                        <p>How Can Play Therapy Help?</p>
                        <p>

                            Play is vital to every child's social, emotional, cognitive, physical,
                            creative and language development. It helps to make all types of learning
                            concrete for children and young people.  Play therapy can help in a variety of ways:</br></br>
                            - Emotional support: to learn more about their thoughts and feelings</br></br>
                            - Playing out of difficult or traumatic experiences in order to make sense
                            of what happened and be better able to cope in the future</br></br>
                            - Learn to manage relationships and conflicts in more appropriate ways</br></br>
                            - Develop confidence and social interaction skills</br></br>
                            Outcomes range from a reduction in anxiety and raised self-esteem to a more
                            specific change in behaviour or relationships.

                Fees are charged at an hourly rate.  The number of sessions will depend upon
                a child's individual needs. However, a minimum of an initial 12 sessions is
                recommended. Additional charges will be applied for travel, attendance of
                professional meetings and report writing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Packages for schools are available upon request and are dependent upon the
                number of children or groups seen in one day.
            </p>
            <p>
                ​​My fees include record keeping, play equipment, external supervision, transport,
                PTUK membership, ICO registration and professional indemnity insurance.
